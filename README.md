Script to create new GMSA Service Accounts


Script to create new GMSA Service Accounts (Groupmanaged)  
This Script does nearly all what is needed to do to use GMSA Accounts. 

The only things you need to do are:  
1. Create an OU in AD where the Groups for the GMSA Accounts will be stored  
2. Add this Information to this Script here  
3. Add your local Domain (here in this Example: home.local) to the Script   

Run the Script and let it create the Account for you  (also Adding the Root Key if needed)
